# Pewlett Hackard Analysis  
## Overview
##### Pewlett Hackard has been primarily using Excel in the past to store and access their HR data, but have decided to update to SQL. We were tasked with assisting them with not only building a new database in SQL, but also analyzing their employee's ages, tenure, and titles to determine who will be retiring soon and how many positions will need to be filled. By determining who is eligble for retirement, we can see what their titles are to determine what positions will be vacant and what current employees may be eligible for a mentorship program to help fill those positions from within the company. 
## Results
##### After identifying the relationships between the existing CSV files, we created the PH-EmployeeDB within SQL. After defining the table names, column names/datatypes, and any primary/foreign keys within SQL's Query Tool, we imported the CSV files into their corresponding database table. Once the tables were created, we could begin to write queries and join tables for the purpose of our analysis: determining which employees are eligble for retirement and which are eligble for a mentorship program. The results of our analysis are below:
- 72,458 employees are currently eligible for retirement. 
- "Senior Engineer" is the title with the most retiring employees and "Manager" is the title with the least retiring employees. 
- 1,549 employees are currently eligble for the mentorship program. 
- Of these eligible employees, the most common title is "Senior Staff" and the least common is "Assistant Engineer".

## Summary
##### Pewlett Hackard will have a significant number of their employees retiring over the next four years, with the company needing to fill 72,458 positions as the 'silver tsunami' retires. Based on the mentorship elegibility table we created, there will not be nearly enough internal employees to fill these positions. Pewlett Hackard will need to either expand their elegibility criteria for the mentorship program or begin to look at hiring from outside the firm.
